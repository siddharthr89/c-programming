1) Given an Integer N
2) if N < 0 / N = 0, Output : Provide Positive Non-Zero Integers Only !
3) For any other value of N do the following-
4) Count from i = 2 to N (exclusive)
5) For each value of i check the following condition-
6) if N is divisible by i, Output: N is not a Prime & exit the function immediately
7) Else Output: N is a Prime
